<p> <h2>I welcome you to the all consuming darkness</h2></p>
<p>You, whom gaze upon this, have found favor with me. How shall I infect this world with pestilence and plague? I am glad that you asked.
    <p> Allow me to, as the kids say, break it down Fam.
        <ul><li>Integrate into worlds goverments and determine weaknesses and stress points, to be used as leverage</li>
        <li>Next, create man-made famine and manipulate weather so as to disallow viable crop growth</li>
    <li>Use "Project Blue Beam" to create a false deity and broadcasting it into the ionisphere with life like three dimensional holograms</li>
<li>Demand arbitrary sacrifices from the masses, withough letting them know which ones appease me</li>
<li>Sit back. Revel in the destruction and fresh constant stream of souls offered to me</li></ul>

<p>They shall see, in time, that I can be a merciful overlord and-akin to Thanos-only wish to bring balance</p>
    <p>If you have made it this far, you are either a true believer or a fool. Either way, I welcome you to my legion of darkness. 
        <p>Now, go forth and spread the word of Soren-Devourer of Souls</p>
